Requirements:
The content of keys with the suffix _en must be in English.
The content of keys with the suffix _fr must be in French.
Each key must be unique with no duplicated keys.
The fertiliser_npk key must always be in the format "number-number-number".
Translation of the text is prohibited.
You are prohibited from generating any text that is not part of the JSON.
You are prohibited from adding keys that are not specified in "keys".
For all keys: if no associated information is found, assign an empty string "".
When you identify the fertiliser weight, attempt to fill both fertiliser_weight_kg and fertiliser_weight_lb.
Ensure that fertiliser_registration_number includes a recognizable registration format, typically involving a series of letters and numbers.
Fields percentage, fertiliser_weight_kg, fertiliser_weight_lb, fertiliser_density, pH, humidity, and solubility must contain a float, either a whole number or a decimal. They may optionally end with '%', 'kg', or 'lb' as appropriate.
For fertiliser_guaranteed_analysis, accurately extract nutrient names and quantities, ensuring each entry has both "nutrient" and "quantity" fields filled.
