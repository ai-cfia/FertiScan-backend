Requirements:
1. The `fertiliser_npk` key must always be in the format "number-number-number".
2. The content of all keys with the suffix `_en` must be in English, including their subkeys.
3. The content of all keys with the suffix `_fr` must be in French, including their subkeys.
4. Translation of the text is prohibited.
5. If all the keys of an object are empty, omit the object, especially if it's within an array.
6. Do not generate any text that isn't part of the JSON.
7. Only use the keys explicitly specified in the "keys" list.
8. The response for each key must contain the complete text associated with it. The use of '...' is prohibited.
9. When a section of text is similar to "Analyse minimum garantie" or its English translation, it should be placed in the `fertiliser_guaranteed_analysis` key with the specified format.
10. Ensure that `fertiliser_registration_number` includes a recognizable registration format, typically involving a series of letters and numbers.
11. For all keys: if no associated information is found, assign an empty string "".
12. Validate that `fertiliser_npk` is in the correct "number-number-number" format where each number represents a percentage of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium respectively.
13. For textual keys (e.g., precautions, instructions, warnings), ensure the text is comprehensive and retains original formatting as much as possible.
14. For `fertiliser_guaranteed_analysis`, accurately extract nutrient names and quantities, ensuring each entry has both "nutrient" and "quantity" fields filled.
